# ContentMock - a Penpot Plugin

Say goodbye to lorem ipsum — ContentMock simplifies your Penpot workflow by
replacing design elements with realistic placeholder data. Quickly mock up
names, numbers, and custom fields to create convincing prototypes without
hassle.

**Why not just use lorem ipsum?** Placeholder text like lorem ipsum doesn’t reflect
real-world usage, making it harder to identify design issues or communicate
intent. Realistic content helps you build prototypes that are clear, practical,
and actually address your users' needs.
